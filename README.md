Android Malware Detection Using Genetic Algorithm based Optimized Feature Selection and Machine Learning.
This study presents an innovative approach for enhancing Android malware detection through a
Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based optimized feature selection coupled with machine learning
techniques. Leveraging the evolutionary principles of GA, the proposed method effectively
identifies a subset of features from a large pool, maximizing the discriminative power while
minimizing computational complexity. By integrating this feature selection mechanism with
machine learning classifiers, the system achieves superior performance in distinguishing
between, benign and malicious Android applications. Through extensive experimentation and
evaluation using real-world datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated, showcasing significant improvements in detection accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency compared to traditional methods. This research contributes to the advancement of
Android security, offering a robust and adaptable solution for combating evolving malware
threats in mobile ecosystems.
